# Python-Flask-CRUD-REST-APP
In this project we are going to create Flask(micro web framework written in Python) based CRUD REST APP. In this video we will create REST API in Flask Web Framework for Create,  Read, Update and Delete Operation. We will use the HTTP Verbs Methods like GET, POST, PUT, UPDATE for creating REST API.

For this at first we wil ceate a "flask-curd-rest-app" directory, and make a virtual environment for thsi app  and install all required modules given below:
>pip install virtualenv
>virtualenv venv
>venv\scripts\activate(For activate resource in windows)
>pip install flask
>pip install flask_restful
>We will use also use POSTMAN, which is a Google Chrome app for interacting with HTTP APIs. It presents you with a friendly GUI for constructing requests and reading responses. You can easily download it from "https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/"
